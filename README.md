### Web design

I learned about the dos and don'ts of homepage layout in web design. Learned about ineffective designs such as PowerPoint and slider layouts, and minimalist homepages that lack substance.

Additionally, key principles of effective layouts include a clear first screen, a structured customer journey, and alignment with user expectations. The recommended optimal layout emphasizes clear initial information, showcases relevant products/services, uniquely introduces the business, incorporates persuasive elements such as testimonials, and closes with a handy call-to-action phrase form. This layout aims to eliminate common design pitfalls, prioritize the user experience, and guide visitors through a logical journey to increase conversions.

Finally, designers consider the order of content and use the suggested layout as a foundation for creating a compelling homepage design.

### Joomla compare Wordpress

By watching learning videos, I gained a more comprehensive understanding of the strengths and features of both content management systems for web development.

When considering the future needs of building and managing a website, I found that for SEO features, especially when it comes to the use of plugins, WordPress performed much better.

However, when it comes to security, Joomla excels with its built-in features and related extensions. This comparison has made it clearer to me that future choices may depend on the requirements of a specific project and the need for specific features. Whichever CMS I ultimately choose, I will be able to utilize their respective strengths to provide strong support for future web development.

This allows the company to be more flexible in responding to changes in market demand and to quickly release new product information and update related content. In this digital age, users' demand for real-time information is growing, and CMS systems provide companies with effective tools to meet this challenge.

When reflecting on the goals of a startup, I realized that focusing on a CMS system not only helps to improve the user experience, but also provides a strategic advantage to the company. A great CMS system not only improves the ease of use of a website, but it also helps build brand identity, promote content marketing, and engage with customers. This further solidifies why I started this company in the first place, to provide comprehensive solutions through the power of technology to meet the diverse needs of users in the digital environment.

## Content Insights
    
During the process of creating my startup, I focused specifically on the importance of a CMS (Content Management System). Through this experience, I gained a deep understanding that in the digital age, an efficient and flexible CMS system is crucial for a company's online presence.

I realized that major CMS systems such as WordPress, Drupal or Joomla are not just simple website building tools, but also powerful content management and publishing platforms. These systems provide intuitive and easy-to-use interfaces that allow users to easily manage and update website content without deep technical knowledge. By using these CMS systems, we are able to quickly publish new product information, update blog content, and flexibly adjust website structure.

This intuitiveness and ease of use directly impacts the user experience. Users are able to find the information they need more quickly, and the process of navigating the site and interacting with the content is much smoother. Additionally, CMS systems often support responsive design, allowing websites to render well on different devices, thus enhancing the mobile user experience.

By specializing in CMS management systems, I am able to provide my clients with a one-stop solution that allows them to easily manage and update their online content to better engage with their target audience. This experience has made me realize that in today's digital business environment, CMS systems are one of the keys to driving the success of an organization, directly affecting the user's perception and engagement experience.
